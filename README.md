# 🔗 C++ Blockchain Implementation

A simple and educational blockchain prototype implemented in C++. This project helps you understand how the underlying mechanics of blockchains work—such as block creation, hashing, proof-of-work (mining), and immutability.

## 📌 Features

- 🧱 Basic block structure
- 🔐 SHA-256 hashing
- 🏗️ Chain building
- ⛏️ Proof-of-work mining
- 🔍 Chain validation & tampering detection

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- **C++ Standard Libraries**
  - `<iostream>` – Input/Output
  - `<vector>` – Chain structure
  - `<ctime>` – Timestamps
  - `<sstream>` – String stream manipulation
  - `<string>` – String operations
- **Hashing**
  - Custom SHA-256 implementation or use external libs like:
    - [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)
